# CS-255 System Analysis and Design

This repository contains the projects related to my CS 255 course at SNHU. This course focuses on the software development lifecycle from a business point of view, starting with collecting requirements from clients to creating use-case, action, and class diagrams.

Official Course Overview In this course, students explore the principles, methodologies, and techniques used in systems development, allowing them to build system models with industry-standard tools. Moreover, students learn to communicate technical concepts and design decisions to various audiences in a professional way.

Project One: Requirements Gathering and Analysis Participate in requirements gathering from the DriverPass client. Then, examine and evaluate these requirements in a business requirements document and a brief model application paper. This project demonstrates proficiency in:

Describing the principles, methodologies, and techniques of systems development. 

Project Two: System Design and Presentation Produce a system design document for the DriverPass system based on the gathered requirements. Next, make a presentation explaining your system design. This project displays proficiency in:

Producing various system models with relevant tools. Presenting and explaining technical concepts to non-technical audiences.


# Final thoughts and Questions

Summary of the DriverPass Project:

The DriverPass project required developing an application for the fictional entity “DriverPass”, a driver’s education school that provides videos, practice tests, real-world driving experience, and preparation for the DMV driving test. The goal was to create an online platform where students could easily access all these resources in one place.

Strengths of the Project Execution:

The project required taking on various roles and responsibilities, making it difficult to identify a specific area of excellence. The individual is satisfied with all aspects of the project, admitting no major problems throughout. This holistic approach demonstrates a high quality of work from start to finish.

Potential for Improvement:

With more time, the individual would like to learn more about UML class diagrams, recognizing that there are multiple ways to express design ideas. The interest is to investigate different diagram options to compare and evaluate their effectiveness.

Importance of User-Centric Design:

The individual stresses the importance of including user needs in system design. Ignoring user requirements can result in system failures or usability issues. Easy access to system features is essential for successful user interaction and satisfaction.

Approach to Software Design:

The individual follows a user-centric approach to software design, imagining the system from the user’s point of view. Based on personal experiences with both good and bad interfaces, they emphasize intuitive design. Moreover, their rational and structured mindset as a programmer helps to create systems that show clarity and efficiency.
